  <h2><b>F1 Qualifying Results: Ferrari star stuns McLaren stars to take incredible pole</b></h2>
  <p>
     <i>Chris Deeley | Saturday, August 2, 2025 at 8:49 PM</i><br><br>
    <b>Ferrari's Charles Leclerc stunned the title-fighting duo of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in taking pole for Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix.</B><br><br>
      The Monegasque driver and team-mate Lewis Hamilton had struggled in Q1 and Q2, the latter being knocked out early to earn 12th on the grid, but a storming last lap saw Leclerc edge out the title challengers.
      The Aston Martins bounced back from being the only team to leave Spa without any points with a brilliant session, 
      Fernando Alonso putting his car fifth with a brilliant lap and team-mate Lance Stroll joining him on the third row.</b><br>

    Life after Christian Horner looks like being much of the same on-track for Red Bull, with Yuki Tsunoda knocked out in the first part of qualifying. Team-mate Max Verstappen struggled mightily too, 
    qualifying eighth after finishing Q1 in 11th and Q2 in eighth.Weather temperatures changed dramatically within the session, 
    with track temperatures dropping more than 25 degrees within the hour's running to impact grid levels and tyre life, as wind speeds picked up.
    <b><h3>How does F1 Qualifying work?</h3></b>
    The qualifying session is split into three finite windows, which provide a dramatic prelude to Sunday's race.
    The bottom five drivers are eliminated at the end of Q1, with a further five eliminated after Q2.Then, Q3 gives us a shootout between the remaining 10 drivers in the battle for positions at the front of the grid.

  <h2><b>2025 NFL trade deadline aftermath: Which teams improved, which clubs should have made moves</b></h2>
  <p>
    <i>By Garrett Podell 2025,11,05</i><br><br>
    <b>Recapping the top stories from the NFL's most active trade deadline</b><br>
    <br><br><img src="images\w640xh480_NFL_trades_we_want_to_see.jpg" alt="NFL official
     | Image:CBS sports" ><br><br>
    The 2025 trade deadline provided the NFL's most action-packed trade deadline of the 21st century. <br><br>
    Twenty-seven players were traded in season in 2025, the most during a year in the past 25 seasons. 
    Three first-round picks changed hands and went over to the New York Jets in their star-studded moves that shipped All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts 
    and All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams to the Dallas Cowboys. The 2025 Jets are the only two in the last 45 years to trade two former first team All-Pros in the same day, per CBS Sports Research. <br><br> 
    With roster around the league solidified with the traded deadline now in the past, here's a look at which NFL teams improved the most, 
    and which teams should have picked up the phone. <br>
    <h3><b>Who improved the most </b></h3> 
    <B>Dallas Cowboys</B> <br>
    The Cowboys entered the 2025 NFL trade deadline with a defense that has played like hot garbage through the first half of the season. They're allowing
    the second-most points per game (30.8 points per game) in the league. 
    They're also the second-worst third down defense (52.6% third down conversion rate allowed) in the last 50 years ahead of only the 1982 Kansas City Chiefs (52.8%). <br>
   <br><B>New york jets</B> <br>
    The 2025 New York Jets (1-7) are the only team with multiple in-season trades for first-round picks in the past 25 seasons. New York isn't one of the most improved teams on paper today,
   but they are one of the league's most improved teams in terms of their future outlook. They now have two first-round picks and two second-round picks in 2026 and a whopping three first-round picks in 2027. 
   There's obviously the mystery element with who they end up picking, 
    but they should be able to fill out their roster nicely over the next two years. <br>
  <h3><b>Who should have made moves</b></h3>
  <b>Kansas city cheifs</b> <br>
    The Kansas City Chiefs needed help at the running back position. Their running backs have combined to rank 28th in the league in scrimmage yards per game and 27th in the league in scrimmage yards per touch. 
  The New York Jets ran a fire sale on most of their core, and running back Breece Hall, 
  who is in the last year of his rookie deal, would have made so much sense for the Chiefs. 
  Hall is one of three active players averaging over 60 yards rushing per game and 30 yards receiving per game for their career along with  Bijan Robinson and Christian McCaffrey. 
  Big miss by the defending AFC champs.

  <h2><b>SA Rugby welcomes news on resumption of playing</b></h2>
  <p>
    <i>ESPN | oct 28, 2025</i><br><br>
    <b> SA Rugby CEO Jurie Roux welcomed the news from the South African Government that rugby has been given the green light to return to the playing field, under certain conditions. </b><br><br>
    The news was gazetted by Mr Nathi Mthethwa, the Minister for Sports, Arts and Culture, on Thursday. It allows for a return to competitive action subject to compliance with measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
    <br><br><img src="images\180617-boks-celebrate.jpg" alt="SA rugby team

    The directions stipulate that contact training, and matches can be played in empty stadiums, with only limited people allowed to attend games as part of essential services to make these events possible and from within a “bio safe environment”.
  <b>“Since the start of this pandemic, we have been working hard at ensuring we get back on the field and we’ve kept the Government informed on our plans throughout the process,”</b> said Roux. <br><br>
  “We are very grateful for the opportunity to move to the next phase of our return-to-play plans and will provide the Department with all the necessary information required, such as venues for matches, to ensure a smooth transition to competitive rugby.
  “Having said that, our eight franchise teams that returned to the training field recently still need a few more weeks of preparation before they will be ready for matches, and from SA Rugby’s side we will assist them with whatever is necessary.
  <b>“At this stage, we hope to have our first matches by early to mid-September and our plans on the structure of the planned competition will be announced in due course, as we have various options to consider.”</b><br><br>
  The Vodacom Bulls, Emirates Lions, Cell C Sharks, DHL Stormers, Toyota Cheetahs, Southern Kings, Tafel Lager Griquas and Phakisa Pumas all started with non-contact training a few weeks ago.
  The return to international competition is not permitted under the new regulations, but Roux said he understood the Government’s need to phase any return to normality.
  “We know the World Rugby window for the Castle Lager Rugby Championship is only in November and December, so we’re hopeful that in due course the government will be in a position to further relax the restrictions,” said Roux.
  “For now, it’s the most important to ensure we get the action underway as we have many stakeholders, such as our broadcast partner, competition and team sponsors and our supporters, who are keen to see some rugby again.”
